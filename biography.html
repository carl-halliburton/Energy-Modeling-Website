			<h2>Biography</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>Tom Halliburton has over 30 years of varied experience in the power industry in New Zealand and other countries. While much of his career has been involved in the application of optimisation techniques to power industry problems, he is also experienced in investment analysis and power system planning. His very wide experience in practical power system modelling gives him an especially good appreciation of the issues that are important, and of what can be usefully achieved by such models. </p>
			<p>Tom was part of the team that built the "Prism" long term power planning model, and later worked in the upgrading of this model into "Spectra", whicville Power Administration, where he assisted in the selecth is still in use some 25 years after development of "Prism" commenced. He also participated in the development of river scheduling models for the Waikato River, the Upper Waitaki Hydro System, and the played a key role in the development of the first model used for the New Zealand Electricity Market.</p>
			<p>While living in the United States, Dr Halliburton worked at the US Department of Energy's Bonneion of an optimisation modeling system for the Federal Columbia River Power System. When at Pacific Gas & Electric Company in San Francisco, California, he was responsible for building a stochastic hydro scheduling model, and had a major influence on the short term planning of hydro power operations. This was achieved by developing and implementing, at each hydro control centre, scheduling models customised to the needs of the specific location. When at Enron, he was responsible for analysis of power systems in numerous countries. He also developed models for gas storage trading operations.</p>
			<p>Tom was instrumental in identifying the suitability for New Zealand conditions of the Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming model (SDDP). This model is developed by Power Systems Research Inc of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He assembled a database to enable its use in New Zealand, and the model has subsequently been used by Transpower NZ, the Electricity Commission and Meridian Energy Ltd.</p>
			<p>
In 2002 Tom returned to New Zealand from the United States and soon afterwards established Energy Modeling Consultants Ltd. He has worked with a wide range of clients building optimisation models and carrying out a variety of power system analysis projects, both in New Zealand and overseas.
Tom holds Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical) (Hons) and PhD degrees from Canterbury University.</p>
