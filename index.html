			Tom works closely with Power Systems Research Incorporated of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Their SDDP model is ideal for many medium and long term hydro-thermal power system analysis needs. For bespoke modeling, Dash Optimization's Xpress-MP optimisation tools have been used. Very efficient development of powerful linear, mixed integer and some types of non-linear models is possible with Dash's Mosel modeling language and the Xpress-MP solver.
